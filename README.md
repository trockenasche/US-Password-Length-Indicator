# UserScript Password Length Indicator

I have written a UserScript which shows if a password field has a character limit.
If an external password manager generates a password that is too long, it would be cut off unrecognisably when it is inserted. With this, it can be easily recognised.

Tested with Firefox and [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
